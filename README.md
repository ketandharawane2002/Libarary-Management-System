📁 Project Structure
🚀 Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

Download from: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
Verify installation: java -version
MySQL Server 8.0 or higher

Download from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
Verify installation: mysql --version
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

Download from: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Step 1: Download MySQL JDBC Driver
Download MySQL Connector/J from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
Extract the downloaded file
Copy mysql-connector-j-8.2.0.jar (or latest version) to the lib/ folder in your project directory
Direct Download Link:

https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-j-8.2.0.zip
Step 2: Setup MySQL Database
Start MySQL Server

# Windows (PowerShell/CMD)
net start MySQL80

# Or use MySQL Workbench to start the server
Create Database

# Login to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

# Enter your MySQL password when prompted
Run the Schema Script

source d:/Java Programming/codveda/level 3/task 4/database/schema.sql

# Or copy and paste the contents of schema.sql in MySQL Workbench
Alternatively, you can use MySQL Workbench:

Open MySQL Workbench
Connect to your local MySQL server
File → Open SQL Script → Select database/schema.sql
Execute the script (⚡ icon or Ctrl+Shift+Enter)
Step 3: Configure Database Connection
Open src/com/library/util/DatabaseConnection.java
Update the database credentials if needed:
private static final String USERNAME = "root";
private static final String PASSWORD = "your_mysql_password";
Step 4: Import Project into Eclipse
Open Eclipse IDE

Import the Project

File → Import → Existing Projects into Workspace
Click "Next"
Browse to: d:\Java Programming\codveda\level 3\task 4
Select the project
Click "Finish"
Add MySQL JDBC Driver to Build Path

Right-click on the project → Properties
Select "Java Build Path"
Click on "Libraries" tab
Click "Add External JARs..."
Navigate to lib/ folder and select mysql-connector-j-8.2.0.jar
Click "Apply and Close"
Note: The .classpath file already references this JAR, but you need to ensure it exists in the lib/ folder

Step 5: Run the Application
Navigate to Main Class

In Eclipse Package Explorer, expand: src → com.library
Find LibraryManagementApp.java
Run the Application

Right-click on LibraryManagementApp.java
Select "Run As" → "Java Application"
If you see connection errors:

Verify MySQL service is running
Check database credentials in DatabaseConnection.java
Ensure the library_management database exists
Verify MySQL JDBC driver is in the build path

Select "1. Add New Book"
Enter book details (title, author, ISBN, etc.)
Book is added with a unique ID
Borrowing a Book
Select "3. Transaction Management"
Select "1. Borrow Book"
Enter User ID and Book ID
System validates and creates transaction with due date
Returning a Book
Select "3. Transaction Management"
Select "2. Return Book"
Enter Transaction ID

🐛 Troubleshooting
Error: "package java.sql is not accessible"
Solution:

Ensure you're using JDK (not JRE)
In Eclipse: Window → Preferences → Java → Installed JREs → Make sure a JDK is selected
Add JDK to build path if needed
Error: "MySQL JDBC Driver not found"
Solution:

Download MySQL Connector/J JAR file
Place it in the lib/ folder
Add to Eclipse build path: Right-click project → Properties → Java Build Path → Libraries → Add JARs
Error: "Cannot connect to database"
Solution:

Verify MySQL service is running: net start MySQL80
Check credentials in DatabaseConnection.java
Ensure database library_management exists
Test connection: mysql -u root -p
Error: "Communications link failure"
Solution:

Check if MySQL is running on port 3306
Verify firewall settings
Update connection URL if using different port
